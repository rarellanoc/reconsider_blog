# Authentic this and that


A football match is a game. A game that can’t be unauthentic, or it would be very dull if unauthentic. That’s not the issue of football, or maybe any finite game. 

When does authenticity become relevant? In media, or in the transformation of a source. Say a mineral water. 

Politics, being a finite game also within a certain class, a big game nonetheless, needs a degree of authenticity in order to thrive, but rhetorics are also highly scientific in their own way. Highly strategic. People never show as they are, but in how they defend principles. 

We can’t split politics into a how-to. It's not a thing to assemble. The how-to of politics is how to solve the problems of a very abstract entity, but very known at the same time: the country. 

But we use certain labels from time to time like social media, which mixes both, so we can teach you first what it is, and second how to win in this game or environment. 

Same with any gear. We can teach you how to use it correctly as if there are incorrect ways in nature. 

So what’s the relationship between a new game, authenticity, and teaching how to?

Because when we teach 'how to' we ARE being strategic, at least a bit, in order to be effective or right, to win ultimately in a certain game. 

We never explain how to on the fly, we are trying to arrive at a correct solution. 

How are politics and society different? Things are valued strangely, outside anyone's grasp, but at the same time are not random. 

How do we even think of authenticity as a thing we can learn how to, when authenticity does not care how to at all. 

But, there are contingencies. We want to play at least in a way we don’t mess things so much, or be expelled from every game. Deep-charge is also not a solution to any game. 

So the question is why we don’t play authentically at every instance at every time? We have learned ways to play beforehand, we are spoiled somehow, by the rewards of certain games, plus we mirror at least a bit when we see another performer, complicating the issue. 

Another problem, we cannot even decide a way to go if it is truly authentic, unless that authenticity includes a sense of direction. Then integrity is necessary, for defense purposes. We are not a trash item either. People will not mop the floor with us. 

But integrity first is not the aim, it would be so of an asshole relationship with the world. I want this, I want that. 

We feel uncomfortable with certain desires also. Why? We don’t even know. Lack of resources can be a reason, and lack of a sense of control could add to this. 

So, maybe we need another little strategy to add a false sense of control, to stay cool. Or at least a guide to not only reacting and bluntly imposing our views. 

But maybe those extra steps are not necessary, but only if we have the awareness that we want and need some things of the world, and that we will be authentic, playing without the luxury of how-to's, maps, or much strategy. This can be traced to the notion that: It’s all good, and all outcomes are good. We don’t need a strategy. 

Playing without strategy most probably leads to failure in the rules of certain games, but we will not care. Or if we do, we will experience the pain. So we still need a little strategy for recovering after pain. 

And, we still need our desires. Awareness of: this is what I want, before any execution. 

Fucking game. Can be the ultimate game, but also can be a rough one. 

Note: Integrity may not be as necessary if all people are good-willed.
