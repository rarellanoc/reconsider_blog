Title: Just start

I was packing my portfolio, went to the courier, and paid the price to send it to one of my heroes. 

Months earlier, I had a dream about it, and a friend was instilling in me to ‘just start’, just start working. I was in the middle of an architectural factory of sorts. I woke up inspired. 

Then, the reply from the office was not conducive to working in person, but following the dream, that didn’t matter. I just started working, doing a podcast as if I was there, in the office, talking to students and peers alike—in marketing terms, my ideal audience, so to speak. 

I wasn’t kidding myself; it was a form of avatar. But at the same time, it was a dose of truth in that dream. Just work, just start. You can read the books if you need some lecture, or you can just work and see ways to contribute publicly via a [public repository](https://github.com/rarellanoc)

But the kick of the story is that I was working with them. Believe it or not, the results on social and the searches reflected that. I was being searched for the tags of my mentors. So it was time to stop. They were certainly not paying me, and also you can’t shine someone else’s light. 

But we all have some ideal office, ideal mentors to work with, and we wait and wait for an opportunity to be ‘on-premises’. Does it f*cking matter where you start working? Either you work for them or you don’t. You don’t need an agreement, you need only the desire. 

I don’t need them anymore, and they don’t need more publicity, from my standpoint. There are plenty of students who will continue working for them subconsciously, even colleagues. A sense of idolatry, but masked, hidden, covert. 

I think is better to make it overt. Then expose the idolatry, and it loses its power. Until we decide to switch.
