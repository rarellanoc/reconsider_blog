The guy is up for the exercise in front of one of the female AMP coaches. He has to ask her questions while she sits in front of him with a loving expectation, so to speak. The guy first question didn't land, as she hesitates. After a couple of directions from Decker, he ask at last a question that causes a tangible effect, despite the fact that the flat responses are also tangible in certain books. 

I wanted to start with this because of the reflection the guy says after leaving the hot seat "It is the intention behind the question that makes the connection". 

A lot has been said about intentions. That's why a meta comment like "Im pacing" worked or landed because he was pacing and directing a sort of interview. That's why in 'the art of being present' a hello feels great, but wanting to go out to say hello feels flat and out of place. Even in a professional setting, my mind was on idolatry as blunt idolatry before I call my idol, thus lifting idolatry skirts, as idolatry, thus losing its grip, thus resulting in a great and fun interaction. 

Intentions are quite the issue. But as we use language also to pinpoint the thing, it becomes sterile too. We can't talk too much about intentions. Same with play, in Decker's playbook. 

But, the guy has always the intention to know her. Doesn't It? 

Not quite, he could had have in mind performing or keeping a good image before the desire. 

A meta comment could work if is about that very moment. Like "I didn't hear what you've said". That's why formula would never work. Even when keeping the work or not very loosely. 

Another guy is up now.

He is one of the most challenged in terms of his body awareness and letting his voice come up as well. A woman coach is in front of him and Decker as usual guiding him. He doesn't have do much, besides being present. In fact the teaching piece is along these lines "Get to a place that you don't have to do shit, from there you can choose her" Decker tells him. The classic dilemma of performance and letting go. The woman is radiant and wanting more of him. 

As our days and going out seeking what we want or what's left to experience, I find myself  in the public transport again. Generally the choice is taxing with women or bored with men. This time I'm alone in my seat. But two giggly girls happen to be in the next seat. 

I usually feel appreciation for women's clothes or stance, not superficial but generally as a pleasurable look that last a couple of seconds. This time is different. 

"This is your yoga", are the words I start to remember from Decker in the workshop working with the guy, as the giggly girls are so expressive that I feel challenged. That words saved my ass, in terms of enjoying the ride of comfort and discomfort. 

Being comfortable being uncomfortable seems one of the contadictions of finite games, or training methods. This time I say to myself: This is what I want more of. 

At least two weeks passed. That bus ride is still on my head. The commercial centre seems flat but appeasing as I watch beautiful women every minute. But something is lacking in my experience. I realize I would never meet all of these people's stories. So I leave. 

But this time I have my yoga in my head. I left the front seats open just in case. And luckily two young ladies repeat the scenario I like. But this time lacks novelty, except for a few glimpses of her beauty and my focus, it was a forced recollection of the initial giggly girls. A comparison at best. I did enjoy her both. But no growth this time, except for the fact that same as we can't go out searching for a 'hello' experience, we just say hello when we want or decide. The scenario of growth can't be replicated, even if it is the closest picture of what I really want.
