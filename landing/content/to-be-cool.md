Title: To be cool

After watching a video about Zuckerberg new outside in change, we can start to question its nature, and why it seems to work. 

it's 2013 and the integral center, a coaching center on circling and meditative community practices release an online program to cover our neglected areas called The List. I re watch the calls years later and I start to question one of the basic premises: Maslow. 

If you are unfamiliar with it google it, but after seeing a bit of James Carse work on our relationship and utter dependence on each other, I'm left with no space but to think on questioning the premise that survival needs go before our relationships. 

Unless is the spacecraft paradise or hell, in which the loner has to face nature and arrange a space for himself, the argument is inapplicable in the current state of the world. 

Thus, we have at least three options. We extend the loner scenario and face the world through machine and self reliance, or we question that even our inner language and cultural influences are people speaking to us in some time and displaced place, thus never alone and dependent. Or, we juggle that one of the stable truths is immortal necessity and titles and enacting wins, a concluded game with our almost useless genius in the middle of it, thus a even subtler blend open to discussion. 

After watching both recordings, and leaving more time for the outside in makeover, some part of myself wants to be cool, thus rendering the task based approach a more nerdy approach, unless we apply our efforts in an outside in fashion, as if top down wins. A lot of work and not even enjoyable. 

I still have yet to meet both leaders, they never spoke to me, so I don't know how its like really. But one thing seems certain, inside out takes more time, understanding takes more time than regurgitation (or hunger vs appetite), and even if both have some merits, the short term approach is tempting. The long term approach has no urgency on it, so can be rendered as mere entertainment. Unless we say it again, under some process. 

But certainly, we might not be able to tell. We might be either skipping ahead and tolerating nasty relationships for the sake of petition and become beggars, no matter the outside appearances. Or we can try to manage our independence to the point of lone survival even in the middle of a community and cultural influence, or the most common blend, using media to separate us, create our mental and professorial cloister, and manage our relatedness, never here never there. Or, the fourth option is to go without media (at least without modern digital technology) in the middle of a world playing a different sport (people already with that digital technology). Again, ronin like, but this time rooted of a beggar like attitude, despite the the high costs and pain that cold bring.
