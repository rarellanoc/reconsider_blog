It's the first Thursday of the year and I start planning a quick trip, a 2-hour reservation spot for a small vineyard storage and conservations facility in Maule, Chile. Next day we arrive, and it was exactly what we expected. A fine care for the grapes, the colonial building and the facilities. In fact, even decorative details were just in place. And of course, the bottles of wine.

After reading the must-be-famous blog post of Tomas Pollak, I'm reconsidering the notion of smoke or shit. Smoke being all the conversations, and shit being, well, organic matter (items), even if only a fraction of what it should be.

I used to code toy projects for fun. Tomas did the same, and one or two turned into cash almost unintentionally. I must say this thou: Tomas is a journalist who loves coding, nothing more nothing less, but that spark he puts in his words give the fresh reset for everyone who might need it.

So, after drinking a 7-year-old bottle, the booze led me to think (I was a bit drunk, so for me was the magic realm pre-pandemic) where startups used to grow (try to remember the time Alpha Go AI documentary was just being released), an inflection point for many startups.

So, I've spent years writing, to not find an audience. I've spent years finding an audience, chasing them, and sometimes feels that I'm there, sometimes feels that I'm miles away.

I don't know if the dilemma of working quietly and selling smoke is real. Because it's intertwined, but maybe it's time to create a tangible product. At least it is for me.
