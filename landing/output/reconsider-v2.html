            <section><p>It's the first Thursday of the year and I start planning a quick trip, a 2-hour reservation spot for a small vineyard storage and conservations facility in Maule, Chile. Next day we arrive, and it was exactly what we expected. A fine care for the grapes, the colonial building and the facilities. In fact, even decorative details were just in place. And of course, the bottles of wine.</p>
<p>After reading the must-be-famous blog post of Tomas Pollak, I'm reconsidering the notion of smoke or shit. Smoke being all the conversations, and shit being, well, organic matter (items), even if only a fraction of what it should be.</p>
<p>I used to code toy projects for fun. Tomas did the same, and one or two turned into cash almost unintentionally. I must say this thou: Tomas is a journalist who loves coding, nothing more nothing less, but that spark he puts in his words give the fresh reset for everyone who might need it.</p>
<p>So, after drinking a 7-year-old bottle, the booze led me to think (I was a bit drunk, so for me was the magic realm pre-pandemic) where startups used to grow (try to remember the time Alpha Go AI documentary was just being released), an inflection point for many startups.</p>
<p>So, I've spent years writing, to not find an audience. I've spent years finding an audience, chasing them, and sometimes feels that I'm there, sometimes feels that I'm miles away.</p>
<p>I don't know if the dilemma of working quietly and selling smoke is real. Because it's intertwined, but maybe it's time to create a tangible product. At least it is for me.</p></section>
